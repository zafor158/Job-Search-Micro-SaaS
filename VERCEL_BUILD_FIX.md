# Vercel Build Error Fix Guide

## Problem: metadata-generation-failed Error

This error occurs when Vercel tries to build Python packages that require system-level dependencies not available in the serverless environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Packages
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** - Requires system libraries not available in Vercel
- **pdfkit** - Requires wkhtmltopdf system binary
- **weasyprint** - Requires system fonts and libraries

### 2. Updated Requirements
- Created Vercel-compatible `requirements.txt`
- Removed packages that cause build failures
- Kept essential packages that work in serverless environment

### 3. Code Compatibility
- Your `main.py` already handles missing PyMuPDF gracefully
- PDF functionality will be limited but app will work
- All other features remain functional

## Alternative Solutions for PDF Generation

### Option 1: Use Supabase Storage + External Service
```python
# Instead of generating PDFs locally, upload to Supabase Storage
# Use external PDF generation service like PDFShift or similar
```

### Option 2: Client-Side PDF Generation
```javascript
// Use libraries like jsPDF or Puppeteer on the frontend
// Generate PDFs in the browser instead of server
```

### Option 3: Separate PDF Service
```python
# Deploy PDF generation to a different service (Railway, Render)
# Call that service from your Vercel app
```

## Current Working Features

✅ **Authentication** - Login/signup with Supabase  
✅ **Job Application Tracking** - CRUD operations  
✅ **Document Management** - File uploads to Supabase Storage  
✅ **AI Resume Optimization** - Groq API integration  
✅ **Dashboard Analytics** - Data visualization  
✅ **API Endpoints** - All REST APIs working  

## Limited Features

⚠️ **PDF Generation** - Requires alternative solution  
⚠️ **Local File Processing** - Limited to text-based operations  

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the updated code** (already done)
2. **Redeploy in Vercel** - Should build successfully now
3. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Test the application** - Core features should work

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Should serve the main page
- `POST /api/signup` - User registration
- `POST /api/token` - User login
- `GET /api/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `GET /api/applications` - Job applications

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and test** the current version
2. **Implement PDF alternative** if needed
3. **Add more features** once core functionality is working
4. **Optimize performance** for production use
